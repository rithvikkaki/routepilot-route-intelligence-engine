# RoutePilot

### ROUTE INTELLIGENCE ENGINE

Plan capacity- and time-window-aware multi-vehicle delivery routes with a constraint solver,
dispatch them, and watch the fleet move in real time — with traffic disruption and live
re-optimization built in.

## What is RoutePilot?

Every delivery business faces the same question each morning: *given N orders and M vehicles,
who delivers what, in what order?* Answer it badly and you burn fuel, miss delivery windows, and
pay for trucks you didn't need.

RoutePilot answers it with a **constraint-based Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) solver**, then runs the
whole operational loop around that answer:

```
Orders + Fleet  →  Optimize (OR-Tools)  →  Review vs baseline  →  Dispatch
                                                                      ↓
              Analytics  ←  Complete  ←  Re-optimize  ←  Traffic hits  ←  Live tracking
```

Every number in the UI — distances, savings, ETAs, utilisation — is **computed from live data**.
Nothing is hard-coded or mocked.

### What makes it non-trivial

| | |
|---|---|
| **Real constraint model** | Capacity, delivery time windows, per-stop service durations, per-vehicle distance caps, and priority-weighted drop penalties — solved simultaneously, not greedily. |
| **Honest benchmarking** | Every plan is solved twice: once with OR-Tools, once with a naive nearest-neighbour heuristic. The UI shows the measured delta, including when the tradeoff is unfavourable. |
| **Backend-authoritative simulation** | Vehicle movement is computed server-side against real database state and streamed over WebSockets. The client renders events; it never invents motion. |
| **Genuine geospatial** | PostGIS `geography` columns with `ST_DWithin` / `ST_Distance` radius search — not latitude/longitude arithmetic in Python. |
| **Recovery, not just planning** | Inject traffic on a live route, see which deliveries go at-risk, then re-sequence only the *undelivered* stops from the vehicle's current position. |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

The only prerequisite is [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
No local Python, Node, or database needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhanoliya-ji/RoutePilot.git
cd RoutePilot
cp .env.example .env          # Windows PowerShell: copy .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

The backend waits for Postgres, applies migrations, enables PostGIS, and seeds demo data
(11 depots including the Guntur/AP Central primary hub + 10 regional hubs, 48 vehicles, ~170 Pan-India orders). When you see
`Application startup complete`:

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| **Web application** | http://localhost:5173 |
| API docs (Swagger) | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| Health check | http://localhost:8000/health |
| Metrics (Prometheus) | http://localhost:8000/metrics |

### Demo accounts

| Role | Email | Password | Can do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dispatcher** | `dispatcher@routepilot.dev` | `dispatch12345` | Everything operational — optimize, dispatch, simulate |
| Admin | `admin@routepilot.dev` | `admin12345` | Dispatcher + user management |
| Viewer | `viewer@routepilot.dev` | `viewer12345` | Read-only |

The login screen has one-click sign-in for each. **Start with Dispatcher.**

> **Port already in use?** If you already run Postgres or Redis locally, override the published
> host ports in `.env` — `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT=55432` and `REDIS_HOST_PORT=56379`.

## 🎬 Try It in 3 Minutes

1. **Sign in** as Dispatcher → land on the **Dashboard** (live KPIs).
2. **Route Planner** → click *Select 50* → *Select all vehicles* → **Optimize Routes**.
   Wait ~15s (the solver's wall-clock budget). You get color-coded routes on the map and a
   measured comparison against the naive baseline.
3. **Accept Plan** → orders become `ASSIGNED`, routes go `PLANNED`.
4. **Live Operations** → pick a speed (1×/5×/20×) → **Start Simulation**.
   Vehicles move; the event feed streams deliveries as they happen.
5. **Break it** → apply **severe traffic** to an active route. You'll get an estimated delay and a
   list of deliveries now at risk of missing their window.
6. **Fix it** → **Re-optimize** that route. Only the undelivered stops are re-sequenced, starting
   from where the vehicle actually is. The running simulation picks up the new plan on its next tick.
7. **Analytics** → savings, utilisation, and per-run improvement trends.

### Route Planner — optimization result vs naive baseline
Selected orders and fleet on the left, solved routes on the map, measured savings on the right.
Here: **3 routes instead of 5 vehicles (−40%)** and **395.92 km vs 486.06 km (−18.5%)** — while
serving all 50 orders. Note the honestly-reported **−17.2% on time**: consolidating onto fewer
vehicles makes each route longer in duration. The solver shows the tradeoff instead of hiding it.

## 🧠 How It Works

### The optimization model

The solver ([`backend/app/optimization/solver.py`](backend/app/optimization/solver.py)) builds an
OR-Tools routing model where node `0` is the depot and nodes `1..n` are orders:

| Component | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Arc cost** | Distance, travel time, or a blended metric, depending on the chosen objective |
| **Capacity** | `AddDimensionWithVehicleCapacity` against each vehicle's `capacity_kg` |
| **Distance cap** | A `Distance` dimension with a per-vehicle max on the route's end cumulative value |
| **Time windows** | A `Time` dimension carrying travel + service time; each order's `CumulVar` is constrained to its delivery window (waiting allowed) |
| **Priority** | Orders are optional via `AddDisjunction` with a **priority-scaled drop penalty**, so urgent orders are the last thing sacrificed |
| **Fleet consolidation** | A fixed cost per used vehicle pushes the solver to use fewer trucks |
| **Search** | `PATH_CHEAPEST_ARC` first solution, then `GUIDED_LOCAL_SEARCH` under a wall-clock budget |

Three objectives are available: `MIN_DISTANCE`, `MIN_TIME`, and `BALANCED`.

Unserved orders are never silently dropped — they're returned with a diagnosed reason
(`CAPACITY_EXCEEDED`, `TIME_WINDOW_INFEASIBLE`, `NO_AVAILABLE_VEHICLE`).

> **Note on time windows:** the planning horizon is anchored at the *earliest* delivery window in
> the batch, so windows are handled as relative offsets. Plans stay valid regardless of the
> absolute calendar date of the data.

### The baseline comparison

To claim a saving you need something to compare against. Every optimization run also solves the
same problem with a **greedy nearest-neighbour heuristic** — hop to the nearest unserved order that
still fits remaining capacity and distance budget, then return to depot. That mimics a dispatcher
routing by hand.

Both results are reported with their **assigned-order counts**, so the comparison stays
apples-to-apples: a baseline that quietly serves fewer orders can't fake a shorter distance.

**The better of the two is what gets dispatched.** A time-budgeted heuristic can stop while still
behind greedy — on a small instance with little CPU, that genuinely happens. Shipping that plan
would mean dispatching routes a human router would have beaten, so the service ranks both plans
using the same distance/vehicle trade-off the solver's own objective encodes (one vehicle ≈ 300 km)
and keeps the winner. Serving more orders always wins over being cheaper. Every run records a
`plan_source` of `solver` or `baseline`, and the UI says so explicitly rather than quietly showing
a 0% gain.

#### A note on the live demo

The hosted demo runs on a free instance with roughly **1/15th of a local CPU core**. The solver's
budget is wall-clock, so it completes far fewer guided-local-search iterations there. Measured
locally on the seeded dataset, varying the budget to emulate the available CPU-time:

| Orders | CPU-time | Result vs baseline |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 50 | ~3 CPU-s | **+20.7%** distance |
| 80 | ~3 CPU-s | **+10.2%** distance |
| 150 | ~3 CPU-s | −0.9% → **dispatches the baseline instead (0%)** |
| 150 | 15 CPU-s | **+7.0%** distance, and 6 vehicles instead of 7 |

**The solve runs as a background job**, so its budget is not capped by how long an HTTP request can
stay open: `POST /optimization/jobs` returns `202` in ~0.1s with a `PROCESSING` run, and progress
streams over the same WebSocket as the fleet telemetry. That extra search time is worth a lot —
measured on the seeded 150-order dataset:

| Budget | Distance | vs baseline |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 15s (inline request) | 672.4 km | +7.0% |
| 180s (background job) | **614.0 km** | **+15.1%** |

Concurrent solves are capped (`MAX_CONCURRENT_OPTIMIZATION_JOBS`, default 2) — each one pins a CPU
for minutes, so an uncapped public endpoint would starve both the solver and the API.

Background jobs are what make the hosted demo work despite that. With a 240s budget, the live
instance now solves **all 150 orders to 672.38 km vs the baseline's 723.33 km — +7.0% on 6 vehicles
instead of 7** (`plan_source: solver`), the same plan a local 15s run finds. Before the solve was
moved off the request path it returned −3.3% there and fell back to the baseline.

The size of the win still varies with which orders you select — the table above is one fixed
subset, not a promise. The guarantee that always holds is the portfolio rule: **the dispatched plan
is never worse than routing by hand**, and the UI says which heuristic produced it.

### The simulation engine

A single asyncio loop ([`backend/app/simulation/engine.py`](backend/app/simulation/engine.py))
ticks once per second and, for each active vehicle:

1. Advances it along its route polyline by `speed × traffic_factor × tick`.
2. On reaching a stop — marks the order `DELIVERED`, timestamps the arrival, writes a
   `DeliveryEvent`, and broadcasts it.
3. Snapshots position into `vehicle_location_history` roughly every 300 m.
4. On returning to the depot — closes the route as `COMPLETED` and frees the vehicle.

Traffic severity maps to a speed factor (`clear 1.0`, `moderate 0.6`, `severe 0.35`,
`breakdown 0.0`). Re-optimization rewrites only `PENDING` stops and the engine reloads that route
on its next tick — completed stops are preserved.

## 📊 Benchmarks

Reproduce these yourself:

```bash
docker compose exec backend python -m scripts.benchmark --sizes 50 100 250 --vehicles 12
```

Synthetic Pan-India / AP logistics corridor orders, 12 uniform vehicles (600 kg, 250 km cap), 15s solver budget:

| Orders | Optimized | Naive baseline | Distance reduction | Orders assigned |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 50 | **261.6 km** | 346.8 km | **24.6%** | 50 / 50 |
| 100 | **375.0 km** | 576.4 km | **34.9%** | 100 / 100 |
| 250 | **771.0 km** | 981.3 km | **21.4%** | 250 / 250 |

**20–35% less distance with 100% order assignment**, measured — not estimated.

### On the seeded demo dataset

The bundled demo fleet is deliberately *heterogeneous* (30 kg bikes through 1500 kg trucks) with
tight delivery windows, which is a harder and more realistic problem. There the gain shows up
differently — a live run over 160 orders:

| Metric | Naive baseline | RoutePilot | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Total distance | 719.82 km | **650.11 km** | **−9.7%** |
| Vehicles used | 10 | **6** | **−40%** |
| Orders assigned | 160 / 160 | 160 / 160 | — |

Fewer vehicles *and* fewer kilometres. Numbers vary with seed, hardware, and solver budget.

## 🌐 Deployment

A [Render](https://render.com) Blueprint ([`render.yaml`](render.yaml)) provisions **PostgreSQL
(PostGIS) + Redis + backend + frontend** on the free tier:

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. On Render: **New → Blueprint** → select the repo → **Apply**.
3. Open the frontend URL and sign in as Dispatcher.

Every cross-service URL is wired with `fromService`, so the blueprint works **unchanged even if
Render appends a suffix** to a service name — nothing needs hand-editing. The backend expands a
scheme-less hostname into a proper CORS origin, and the frontend derives `https://` / `wss://`
from the injected backend host.

Step-by-step guide, including Railway and Fly.io notes: **[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)**.

### On AWS (free tier)

A single EC2 `t3.micro` runs the whole stack with Docker Compose behind Caddy, which supplies
free auto-renewing HTTPS. Postgres/PostGIS and Redis stay on the private Docker network with no
published ports, so the instance exposes only 22, 80 and 443. No load balancer and no NAT
Gateway, because neither is free-tier eligible.

```bash
export SITE_ADDRESS=routeos.<your-ip-with-dashes>.sslip.io
docker compose -f aws/docker-compose.aws.yml up -d --build
```

Full walkthrough from creating the AWS account to a live URL, with cost guardrails and the
production architecture it would grow into: **[aws/AWS-DEPLOY.md](aws/AWS-DEPLOY.md)**.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All configuration is environment-driven — see [`.env.example`](.env.example). Notable knobs:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SOLVER_TIME_LIMIT_SECONDS` | `15` | Wall-clock budget per optimization run. Raise it on slow/shared CPUs — the budget is wall-clock, not CPU-time |
| `SOLVER_FIRST_SOLUTION_STRATEGY` | `PATH_CHEAPEST_ARC` | OR-Tools first-solution heuristic. Dominates the result when the local search gets few iterations |
| `ROAD_DISTANCE_FACTOR` | `1.25` | Multiplier converting straight-line to road distance |
| `AVERAGE_SPEED_KMH` | `30` | Urban speed used for travel-time estimates |
| `USE_OSRM` | `false` | Use a real OSRM routing matrix instead of the haversine fallback |
| `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS` | localhost | Comma-separated; bare hostnames are expanded to `https://` |

`DATABASE_URL` accepts the standard `postgres://` string managed hosts hand out — the app derives
both the async (`asyncpg`) and sync (`psycopg`, for Alembic) drivers itself.

Secrets are never committed; `.env` is git-ignored.

**Reset everything and reseed:**

```bash
docker compose down -v && docker compose up --build
```

## 📐 Design Notes & Limitations

Stated plainly, because a portfolio project should be honest about its edges:

- Fleet movement is a **simulation**, not real GPS telemetry. The engine is backend-authoritative
  and mutates real database state, but the vehicles aren't real.
- VRP is **NP-hard**. This is a heuristic under a wall-clock budget — high-quality feasible routes,
  not proven optima. Because the budget is wall-clock rather than CPU-time, **solution quality
  depends on the hardware it runs on**; on a starved instance the solver can fail to beat greedy,
  which is why the service dispatches whichever plan actually wins and labels it.
- Distances default to **haversine × a road factor**. Set `USE_OSRM=true` for a real road-network
  matrix (the public OSRM demo server is rate-limited; the app falls back automatically).
- The optimizer is **operations research / constraint programming**, not machine learning.
- Route polylines are drawn stop-to-stop, so they don't trace actual streets unless OSRM is on.
