"""Naive nearest-neighbour baseline used to quantify optimizer improvement.

Greedy strategy: for each vehicle (in turn), repeatedly hop to the nearest
unserved order that still fits remaining capacity, distance budget and the
delivery window (waiting is allowed, late arrivals are not), until the vehicle
is full or nothing fits, then return to depot. This mimics a dispatcher routing
by hand and provides an honest, computed comparison point — no numbers are
hard-coded.
